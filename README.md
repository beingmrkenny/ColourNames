# ColourNames
Translates a hex code into a simple description of colour

Version 0 (broken, don't use this yet)

There are many classes and scripts which do something, but they all seem to map colours to those silly CSS names, which nobody serious actually uses â€” either in code or in real life. More importantly, these classes get it wrong more than they get it right because they're trying to be more precise than is possible.

This project aims to translate a colour into a simple, generic name such as "pale blue", or "dark orange-red".

Also, sweet holy Christ, it won't require you to build anything, install node, require something, import something, convert from some bullshit bastardised version of JavaScript or any of that other bollocks. Just pick it up and drop it into your own code and it will:

- Just

- Fucking

- Work
